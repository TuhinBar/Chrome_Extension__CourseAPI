## Introduction :

- This is a chrome extension which can be very usefull for students from every field. This extension will help anyone to get random free courses from udemy and some coupons from amazon and datacamp. 
- There is not specified catagory of courses, anyone can get randomize courses like -->

-  `Digital Marketing` --> `Facebook ad courses`, `SEO Marketing`.
-  Along with `Accounting`, `Test` related courses and more. 

## Process :

- I have creted this extension using my FREE COURSE API. ðŸ‘‰[FREECOURSES_API](https://github.com/TuhinBar/freecourses_API).
- This is a simple chrome extension using `JavaScript`, `HTML`,`CSS`.
- I used Fetch to make the API call and temporarily stored them into arrays.
- Then loffped through the arrays to get the strings and populate to HTML page.
- You can check out the [Manifest](https://github.com/TuhinBar/Chrome_Extension__CourseAPI/blob/main/manifest.json) here.

### It is not `illeagal` `THE API IS FETCHING ONLY THOSE COURSES WHICH ARE FREE FOR TODAY USING COUPONS ALSO THESE ARE OFFICAL COURSES`.
